# Personal Distro Configurator

Personal Distro Configurator (PDC) is a framework to run scripts based on a yaml file. The propose is simple and the motivations was many.

The idea here is configure what you need on a yaml file, running scripts based on this configuration. To help, plugins that do some job can be done, needing to configure what or how the plugin must execute on a simple yaml.

Another way to use maybe is just get your own scripts and execute it the way you want. There is no limit to how to use it.

Any language can be used (Bash, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java...) !
