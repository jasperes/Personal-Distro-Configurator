# Personal Distro Configurator

Personal Distro Configurator (PDC) is a framework to install and configure everything you want on your distro. With it, you can transform a fresh linux install into your personal distro!

## Getting Started

To create your own configurator, you must create a `pdc.yml` file. This file contains informations about what and how PDC must configure your distro.

Some samples on how it will be on `samples` folder. In future, a way to run will be done.

### Requirements

**All you need is a linux system!**

We don't want to install or configure something that can be unhappy to do.

Currently, it's 100% bash script. But can needed python in future, what normally your distro got.

## Documentation

As this project are not done yet, we haven't created a documentation.

In future, we will create something that will help you to create a good PDC file
to configure your distro.

## Getting Involved

For now, not so much can be done to help. We are looking for the best
way to create a good framework to configure your distro.

**BUT** if you wanna help us, create an issue with a good idea, what you think can be done or something else.
We will be happy with it!
